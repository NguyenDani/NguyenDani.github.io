            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
              Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Daniel Nguyen, a passionate 
              and versatile individual with a strong background in computer 
              science and intelligence analysis. With a Bachelor's degree in 
              Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics from the University 
              of Houston, along with an Intelligence Analyst Diploma from the 
              United States Army Intelligence Center of Excellence, I bring a 
              unique blend of technical expertise and analytical skills to the 
              table.
            </p>
            <p>
              I possess a wide range of programming skills, including 
              proficiency in Java, C++, and PowerShell, as well as experience 
              with Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, R, and various other 
              languages. Furthermore, I hold a Top Secret Security Clearance, 
              demonstrating my commitment to confidentiality and 
              professionalism.
            </p>
            <p>
              With my strong technical skills, analytical mindset, and 
              dedication to excellence, I am excited to tackle new challenges 
              and contribute to impactful projects. Feel free to explore my 
              portfolio and get in touch if you have any questions or 
              opportunities for collaboration.

            <h1>Experiences</h1>
            <h3>CenterPoint Energy</h3>
            <h3>Control Systems Developer</h3>
            <p>
              During my tenure as a Co-Op Control Systems Developer at 
              CenterPoint Energy from February 2022 to August 2022, I 
              achieved significant accomplishments that streamlined 
              operations and enhanced productivity. Through the 
              implementation of PowerShell automation, I successfully 
              eliminated manual tasks, such as adding and deleting users 
              from the domain, checking Windows updates on connected 
              workstations, and generating reports, resulting in a 
              saving of 10 labor hours per week. Additionally, I 
              constructed and maintained more than 50 consoles, e
              nsuring the smooth expansion and upgrade of the enterprise 
              footprint while minimizing disruptions to operator workflow. 
              Moreover, I devised an alias in Linux that facilitated seamless 
              navigation across 54 domains, and I created a batch script 
              enabling the instantaneous creation of over 70 tunnels to 
              domains. Another notable achievement was my ability to 
              optimize and debug codes created by senior engineers and 
              system architects, mitigating data compatibility errors 
              by seamlessly integrating large data sets between Linux 
              and Windows systems.

            <h3>Texas Army National Guard</h3>
            <h3>Intelligence Analyst</h3>
            <p>
              During my service in the Texas Army National Guard as an 
              Intelligence Analyst, from April 2016 to April 2022, I 
              held the rank of E4 Specialist (SPC) and undertook various 
              responsibilities that showcased my leadership, organizational, 
              and problem-solving skills. I excelled in developing and 
              presenting detailed mission plans to commanders and company 
              personnel during monthly drills and annual training. In addition, 
              I managed, inspected, and maintained equipment valued at over 
              $2 million, ensuring its proper working condition for mission 
              readiness. As a trainer, I successfully imparted vital warrior 
              skills and intelligence oversight knowledge to 50 to 100 
              soldiers, covering areas such as wound and injury care treatment, 
              military vehicle operation, terrain analysis, and intelligence 
              gathering.
