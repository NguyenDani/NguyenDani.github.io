            <p>
              Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Daniel Nguyen, a passionate 
              and versatile individual with a strong background in computer

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Control Systems Developer</h3>
            <p>
              During my tenure as a Co-Op Control Systems Developer at 
              CenterPoint Energy from February 2022 to August 2022, I 
              achieved significant accomplishments that streamlined 
              operations and enhanced productivity. Through the 
              implementation of PowerShell automation, I successfully 
              eliminated manual tasks, such as adding and deleting users 
              from the domain, checking Windows updates on connected 
              workstations, and generating reports, resulting in a 
              saving of 10 labor hours per week. Additionally, I 
              constructed and maintained more than 50 consoles, e
              nsuring the smooth expansion and upgrade of the enterprise 
              footprint while minimizing disruptions to operator workflow. 
              Moreover, I devised an alias in Linux that facilitated seamless 
              navigation across 54 domains, and I created a batch script 
              enabling the instantaneous creation of over 70 tunnels to 
              domains. Another notable achievement was my ability to 
              optimize and debug codes created by senior engineers and 
              system architects, mitigating data compatibility errors 
              by seamlessly integrating large data sets between Linux 
              and Windows systems.

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Intelligence Analyst</h3>
            <p>
              During my service in the Texas Army National Guard as an 
              Intelligence Analyst, from April 2016 to April 2022, I 
              held the rank of E4 Specialist (SPC) and undertook various 
              responsibilities that showcased my leadership, organizational, 
              and problem-solving skills. I excelled in developing and 
              presenting detailed mission plans to commanders and company 
              personnel during monthly drills and annual training. In addition, 
              I managed, inspected, and maintained equipment valued at over 
              $2 million, ensuring its proper working condition for mission 
              readiness. As a trainer, I successfully imparted vital warrior 
              skills and intelligence oversight knowledge to 50 to 100 
              soldiers, covering areas such as wound and injury care treatment, 
              military vehicle operation, terrain analysis, and intelligence 
              gathering.

            <h3>Chess with Java</h3>
            <p>
              My project is an interactive Player vs Player (PvP) chess application 
              developed using Java, Maven, and Swing. The primary aim was to create 
              a user-friendly platform for chess enthusiasts to engage in matches 
              against each other seamlessly. <a href="https://github.com/NguyenDani/Chess-Java"

            <h3>Messaging web app on MERN</h3>
            <p>
              I developed a messaging web application that provides users with the 
              ability to log in, search for other users, and engage in real-time 
              chat conversations. Leveraging the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, 
              React.js, Node.js) stack, the application offers a seamless 
              and responsive user experience. <a href="https://github.com/NguyenDani/Messaging-MERN"

            <p>
              The Task Management App is a web-based platform designed to streamline 
              task organization and collaboration. Built on the MEAN (MongoDB, 
              Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js) tech stack, it offers users a 
              seamless experience in managing their to-do lists and facilitates 
              collaboration by allowing users to invite others to join and 
              contribute to shared lists. <a href="https://github.com/NguyenDani/Task-Management-MEAN"
